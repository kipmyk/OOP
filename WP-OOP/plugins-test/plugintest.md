## Designing a class around WordPress hooks

In this example, we have a class called `MyPlugin_Feature_Class` that encapsulates a specific feature or functionality in your plugin. The class has a constructor method __construct() where you can initialize the feature by hooking into appropriate WordPress actions or filters.

In the constructor, we're using the `add_action()` and `add_filter()` functions to register methods of the class as callbacks for specific WordPress hooks. For example, on_wp_loaded() is registered as a callback for the wp_loaded action, and modify_content() is registered as a callback for the the_content filter.

The `on_wp_loaded()` method is where you can perform any initialization tasks specific to your feature. You can add your custom code inside this method to set up the feature when the wp_loaded action is triggered.

The `modify_content()` method is an example of how you can modify the content of posts or pages using a filter. You can add your custom code inside this method to modify the content as needed.

Finally, outside the class, you can create an instance of the `MyPlugin_Feature_Class` class by instantiating it with `$my_plugin_feature = new MyPlugin_Feature_Class()`;. This will trigger the constructor and register the appropriate hooks for your feature.

By designing your classes around WordPress hooks, you can modularize your code and easily extend or modify the functionality of your plugin by hooking into the appropriate actions or filters.
