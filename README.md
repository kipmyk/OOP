# OOP

### PHP OOP - Classes and Objects

A class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of class.

A class is defined by using the class keyword, followed by the name of the class and a pair of curly braces ({}).

** Note: In a class, variables are called properties and functions are called methods! **
