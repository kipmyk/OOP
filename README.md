# Object-oriented programming - OOP

## Important of Object-oriented programming over procedural programming:

1. OOP is faster and easier to execute
2. OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
3. OOP helps to keep the PHP code DRY and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
4. OOP makes it possible to create fully reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

### PHP OOP - Classes and Objects

A class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of class.

A class is defined by using the `class` keyword, followed by the name of the class and a pair of curly braces ```({})```.

**Note: In a class, variables are called properties and functions are called methods!**
