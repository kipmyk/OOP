# OOP - Object-oriented programming

## Importants of Object-oriented programming over procedural programming:

OOP is faster and easier to execute
OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
OOP helps to keep the PHP code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

### PHP OOP - Classes and Objects

A class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of class.

A class is defined by using the `class` keyword, followed by the name of the class and a pair of curly braces ```({})```.

**Note: In a class, variables are called properties and functions are called methods!**
